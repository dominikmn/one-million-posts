# Discussion threads are on average 47 comments wide, whereas the median is at 13 comments. We have a minimum of one thread per article (in contrast to zero!) and a maximum of 2137 threads on the same article.

# We want to analyze article discussions, therefore we want to know the discussion width for leaf nodes that have a node depth greater than one:

# %% [markdown]
# The width of discussion trees is on average 39.08 posts per article. The median is 11 threads, the minimum one, and the maximum 1783 threads.

# %% [markdown]
# The article 'FlÃ¼chtlingsthema katapultiert Strache auf Platz eins' has 1783 threads.

# %% [markdown]
# ### How long are discussion threads?
#
# The length of a discussion tree is defined by the number of posts between a leaf node and its root node.

# %% [markdown]
# We want to analyze article discussions, therefore we want to know the discussion length for leaf nodes that have a node depth greater than one:

# %%
df.query("node_type == 'leaf' and node_depth > 1").node_depth.describe()

# %% [markdown]
# The length of discussion trees in on average 3.19 posts per thread. The median is 3 posts per thread. The minimum is two post per thread and the maximum 62.

# %% [markdown]
# ### How long are discussion sub-threads?
#
# A subthread starts at any parent node that has two nodes referencing it.

# %%
df.query("number_subthreads > 0").number_subthreads.describe()

# %% [markdown]
# The average number of sub-threads starting at a post is 0.69. The miminum and the median is zero (not surprisingly, as there are more leaf posts than parent posts). The maximum is 31 posts referencing the same post.
